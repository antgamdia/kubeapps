# Deploy and Configure Kubeapps on VMware Tanzu™ Kubernetes Grid

[VMware Tanzu™ Kubernetes Grid™ (TKG)](https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid) is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes runtime that streamlines operations across a multi-cloud infrastructure. It can run both on-premise in vSphere and in the public cloud and includes signed and supported versions of open source applications to provide all the key services required for a production Kubernetes environment.

[Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com/) provides a web-based dashboard to deploy, manage, and upgrade applications on a Kubernetes cluster. It is a one-time install that gives you a number of important benefits, including the ability to:

- browse and deploy Helm charts from public or private chart repositories;
- customize deployments through an intuitive, form-based user interface;
- upgrade, manage and delete the applications that are deployed in your Kubernetes cluster;
- browse and provision external services from the Service Catalog and available Service Brokers.

[This guide](introduction.md) walks you through the process of configuring, deploying and using Kubeapps on a VMware Tanzu™ Kubernetes Grid cluster.
